Name: Kabina Giri  
Course: AI Lab  

## Task 1: Simple Linear Regression (Single Feature)
In this task, a simple linear regression model is built using one feature
(HouseAge) from the California Housing Dataset to predict the median house value.

The complete machine learning pipeline is followed:
- Data Collection
- Data Cleaning
- Feature Selection
- Model Training
- Evaluation
- Interpretation

## Task 2: Multiple Linear Regression (All Features)
In this task, a multiple linear regression model is built using all available
features except the target variable (MedHouseVal).

Feature scaling is applied and the model performance is compared with Task 1.

## Tools Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- Matplotlib

This repository contains the complete implementation, explanations,
visualizations, and results for both tasks.
